# Dispatch Core Team

## Weekly meetings (date/time TBD)

Weekly meetings will be a chance for us to:
- Go over all current and new assignments
- Team member check-ins
- Work together on solving problems

The first 10-15 minutes of each meeting will be spent going over assignments and check-ins, followed by an optional group work session. These meetings are mostly an opportunity for us to get together in the same room once a week -- after all, we are a team!

**Check-ins**

Weekly meetings will include a mandatory check-in from each team member. To check in, you simply have to let the project lead (Cindy) know what you're working on and how much progress you've made. If you haven't made much progress (or none at all), don't worry about it -- this is mainly just to make sure everybody's on the same page.

**Meetings are not mandatory -- if you can't make it, just check-in over Slack on the day of the meeting.**

## Education

Many of the team members are still new to web development, which is awesome! We want The Ubyssey to be a place where people can practice and improve their skills. 

**Team members are encouraged to come to meetings/office hours to get one-on-one help with their assignments.** You can seek help from Peter or any of the other team members.

We will also be posting better documentation for common web development techniques. Stay tuned!
